# 🧠 Machine Learning Portfolio – Kaggle Notebooks

Welcome to my machine learning project portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my Kaggle notebooks, including trained models, datasets, and exploratory analyses. Each notebook reflects hands-on implementation of machine learning concepts, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and insights.

## 🚀 Highlights

- 📊 **Data Exploration**: Visual and statistical analysis of real-world datasets.
- 🧪 **Model Development**: Supervised learning models (classification/regression), feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning.
- 📈 **Performance Evaluation**: Use of metrics such as accuracy, ROC-AUC, F1-score, RMSE, etc.
- 🧰 **Tools Used**:
  - Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Jupyter Notebooks (Kaggle environment)
 
## 📌 Notes

- These notebooks were developed in the Kaggle environment and exported here for sharing purposes.
- All datasets used are either publicly available on Kaggle or generated as part of the workflow.
